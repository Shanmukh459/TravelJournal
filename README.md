# Travel Journal

## This is a assignment project as part of my Front-end (React) learning in Scrimba

1. This a static web page which is built using React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

2. The main focus of this project is to implement the props concept from React and render them using map.

3. The data here is coming from a data.jsx file instead of hardcoding the text.
